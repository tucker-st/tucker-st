# 👋 Hi, I'm a Cybersecurity Professional

**Cloud Security \| DevSecOps \| Infrastructure Governance**

Mission-focused cybersecurity professional supporting complex,
high-availability operational environments and enterprise systems.
Background includes security governance, continuous monitoring,
operational risk management, and protection of long-lifecycle systems
within regulated environments.

Extending traditional infrastructure security discipline into modern
cloud-native and DevSecOps environments --- with emphasis on
auditability, least privilege, operational continuity, and sustainable
architecture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Professional Focus

Cybersecurity professional specializing in:

-   Security governance and continuous monitoring\
-   Virtualized platform security (VMware, KVM)\
-   Linux system hardening and validation\
-   Compliance-aligned infrastructure operations\
-   Secure cloud adoption and guardrail implementation

**Objective:** Build cloud environments that are secure, observable, and
operationally resilient from day one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔐 Core Expertise

-   Cybersecurity for mission-critical and enterprise systems\
-   Governance frameworks and audit readiness\
-   Vulnerability management and remediation tracking\
-   Operational risk management\
-   Secure Linux administration

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ☁️ Cloud Security & DevSecOps Focus

-   AWS security architecture fundamentals\
-   Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)\
-   CI/CD security integration (Jenkins)\
-   Configuration management (Ansible)\
-   Secure hybrid and on-prem → cloud transition models

Cloud adoption is approached through guardrails, least privilege,
visibility, and controlled change management --- not unchecked feature
velocity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Approach to Engineering & Security

-   Read the requirement carefully\
-   Plan before implementation\
-   Implement minimally\
-   Validate immediately\
-   Reboot and re-validate

**If it doesn't survive reboot, it isn't finished.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💼 Professional Philosophy

-   Security controls should be enforced, not bypassed\
-   Automation should amplify understanding, not obscure risk\
-   Validation and documentation are part of the system\
-   Clean, minimal systems are easier to secure and sustain\
-   Modernization must respect operational realities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🤝 Collaboration

Open to collaboration in:

-   Secure infrastructure design\
-   DevSecOps enablement\
-   Cloud security transition strategies\
-   Compliance-aware automation

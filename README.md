# 👋 Hi, I’m a Cybersecurity Professional (Cloud Security Upskilling)

**Cybersecurity | Virtualized Platforms | Cloud Security (Upskilling) | C4ISR | DevSecOps**

Mission-focused cybersecurity professional with **30+ years supporting DoD and classified operational environments**, including **6 years in dedicated cybersecurity roles** securing **C4ISR platforms**. Background spans operations, mission assurance, and **ISSO leadership**, with deep experience securing **long-lifecycle systems** under **RMF**.

Currently **upskilling in cloud security and DevSecOps**, building on a foundation of securing **physical and virtualized platforms** while supporting modernization efforts and maintaining mission continuity.

---

## 🎯 Professional Focus

Cybersecurity professional with **hands-on experience securing physical, virtualized, and mission-critical systems**, specializing in:

- **RMF sustainment and audit readiness**
- **Virtualized platform security (VMware, KVM)**
- **Linux system hardening and validation**
- Bridging **traditional infrastructure security** with **cloud and DevSecOps practices**

Currently focused on **cloud security and DevSecOps upskilling**, with an emphasis on disciplined, production-safe transitions rather than lift-and-shift experimentation.

Best aligned with roles that value **operational security maturity**, compliance discipline, and pragmatic modernization.

## 📌 Featured Project

### 🔹 RHCSA (EX200) Practice Repository – RHEL 10

A **hands-on Linux administration and validation repository** designed to mirror **real Red Hat exam conditions and real operational environments**.

This project emphasizes:
- Outcome-based configuration
- Security-first defaults (SELinux enforcing, firewalld enabled)
- Persistence and reboot validation
- Minimal, auditable changes
- Read-only auto-grading paired with manual validation

**What it includes:**
- Structured labs (users, storage, networking, services, SELinux, scripting, containers)
- VM build and reset guides
- Manual validation checklists
- Read-only auto-grading scripts
- Timed mock exam with grading rubric
- One-page exam cram sheet

**Why it matters professionally:**
- Demonstrates disciplined Linux administration
- Reinforces reliability and security habits
- Mirrors production and compliance-driven environments
- Avoids fragile or shortcut configurations

## 🔍 How I Approach Problems

- Read the requirement carefully
- Plan before typing
- Implement minimally
- Validate immediately
- **Reboot and re-validate**

If it doesn’t survive reboot, it isn’t finished.

---

## 💼 Professional Philosophy

- Automation should **amplify understanding**, not hide mistakes
- Security controls should be **enforced**, not bypassed
- Validation and documentation matter as much as configuration
- Clean, minimal systems are easier to secure and maintain
- Modernization should respect operational reality

---

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub focuses on:

- Infrastructure-as-Code patterns for secure environments
- DevSecOps labs and reference implementations
- Linux hardening and automation examples
- Documentation-driven security workflows

> Repositories are designed to be **practical**, **auditable**, and **production-oriented**.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

Interested in collaboration around:

- Secure infrastructure design
- DevSecOps enablement
- Cloud security transition strategies
- Compliance-aware automation

Feel free to open issues or discussions on relevant repositories.

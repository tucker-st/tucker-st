# 👋 Hi, I’m a Cybersecurity Professional (Cloud Security & DevSecOps Upskilling)

**Cybersecurity | Virtualized Platforms | Cloud Security | C4ISR | DevSecOps**

Mission-focused cybersecurity professional with **30+ years supporting DoD and classified operational environments**, including **6 years in dedicated cybersecurity roles** securing **C4ISR and mission-critical platforms**. Background spans operations, mission assurance, and **ISSO leadership**, with deep experience securing **long-lifecycle systems** under **RMF**.

I am currently **upskilling in cloud security and DevSecOps**, intentionally bridging traditional infrastructure security with modern AWS, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure-as-Code practices — without abandoning operational discipline, auditability, or mission continuity.

---

## 🎯 Professional Focus

Cybersecurity professional specializing in:

- **ISSO / RMF sustainment** and continuous monitoring
- **Virtualized platform security** (VMware, KVM)
- **Linux system hardening** and validation
- **Compliance-aware infrastructure operations**
- Pragmatic, security-first cloud adoption

My focus is on **doing cloud securely and correctly**, not rapidly or experimentally.

---

## 🔐 Core Expertise

- Cybersecurity for **C4ISR and mission systems**
- **RMF**, audit readiness, and POA&M management
- Vulnerability management (**ACAS**)
- Mission assurance and inspection support
- Secure Linux system administration

---

## ☁️ Cloud Security & DevSecOps (Upskilling Focus)

- AWS cloud security fundamentals
- Infrastructure as Code (**Terraform**)
- CI/CD pipelines (**Jenkins**)
- Configuration management (**Ansible**)
- Secure hybrid and on-prem → cloud transition patterns

Cloud learning is approached through **guardrails, least privilege, and visibility**, not shortcuts.

### 🔹 AWS Cloud Security Foundations
A **security-first AWS learning repository** focused on IAM, logging, network controls, and audit-ready cloud design.

- Shared responsibility model
- Least-privilege IAM patterns
- Visibility and logging fundamentals
- Certification-aligned without “click-through” labs

---

### 🔹 AWS EKS Secure Foundations
A **single-region, security-first Amazon EKS foundation** built with Terraform.

- IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) with OIDC
- Secure EKS add-ons deployed via Helm
- Observability and operational readiness
- Explicit scope and guardrails (not multi-region)

This repo emphasizes **auditability, correctness, and operational realism** over feature sprawl.

## 🔍 How I Approach Problems

- Read the requirement carefully
- Plan before typing
- Implement minimally
- Validate immediately
- **Reboot and re-validate**

If it doesn’t survive reboot, it isn’t finished.

---

## 💼 Professional Philosophy

- Security controls should be **enforced**, not bypassed
- Automation should **amplify understanding**, not hide risk
- Validation and documentation are part of the system
- Clean, minimal systems are easier to secure and maintain
- Modernization must respect operational reality

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

Open to collaboration around:

- Secure infrastructure design
- DevSecOps enablement
- Cloud security transition strategies
- Compliance-aware automation

Issues and discussions are welcome where appropriate.

_This profile and its repositories are intended to demonstrate **practical skill, operational judgment, and security discipline** — not theoretical security alone._

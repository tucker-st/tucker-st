# 👋 Hi, I'm a Cybersecurity Professional (Cloud Security & DevSecOps)

**Cybersecurity \| Virtualized Platforms \| Cloud Security \|
DevSecOps**

Mission-focused cybersecurity professional with extensive experience
supporting complex, high-availability operational environments,
including dedicated cybersecurity roles securing enterprise and
mission-critical platforms. Background includes security governance,
operational risk management, mission assurance, and protecting
long-lifecycle systems within regulated environments.

Now focused on advancing cloud security and DevSecOps capabilities ---
integrating traditional infrastructure security discipline with modern
AWS, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure-as-Code practices. My approach
emphasizes operational continuity, auditability, least privilege, and
sustainable architecture over rapid experimentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Professional Focus

Cybersecurity professional specializing in:

-   Security governance and continuous monitoring\
-   Virtualized platform security (VMware, KVM)\
-   Linux system hardening and validation\
-   Compliance-aligned infrastructure operations\
-   Security-first cloud adoption

The objective is to build cloud environments that are secure,
observable, and operationally resilient from day one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔐 Core Expertise

-   Cybersecurity for mission-critical and enterprise systems\
-   Governance frameworks and audit readiness\
-   Vulnerability management and remediation tracking\
-   Operational risk management\
-   Secure Linux system administration

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ☁️ Cloud Security & DevSecOps Focus

-   AWS security architecture fundamentals\
-   Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)\
-   CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins)\
-   Configuration management (Ansible)\
-   Secure hybrid and on-prem → cloud transition patterns

Cloud adoption is approached through guardrails, least privilege,
visibility, and controlled change management.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 How I Approach Problems

-   Read the requirement carefully\
-   Plan before implementation\
-   Implement minimally\
-   Validate immediately\
-   Reboot and re-validate

If it doesn't survive reboot, it isn't finished.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💼 Professional Philosophy

-   Security controls should be enforced, not bypassed\
-   Automation should amplify understanding, not obscure risk\
-   Validation and documentation are part of the system\
-   Clean, minimal systems are easier to secure and sustain\
-   Modernization must respect operational realities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🤝 Collaboration

Open to collaboration around:

-   Secure infrastructure design\
-   DevSecOps enablement\
-   Cloud security transition strategies\
-   Compliance-aware automation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This profile and its repositories demonstrate practical skill,
operational judgment, and security discipline applied to modern cloud
environments.
